The class should have a constructor, a method to add elements, and a method to find the length of the vector.\n\nFacts:\n1) Classes in C++ provide a framework for encapsulation, which is the process of grouping related variables and functions into a single unit.\n2) The first thing you need to do to define a class is write the keyword class followed by the name of the class.\n3) A class definition in C++ starts with the keyword class followed by the class name; and the class body, enclosed by a pair of curly braces.\n4) A constructor in C++ is a special method within a class that initializes the objects of the class.\n5) The methods to add elements and find the length of the vector can be defined within the class.\n\nSubproblems, Answers, Hints, Incorrect Responses and Feedback:\n\nSubproblem 1: Define the class named \"Vector\".\nAnswer: \n```cpp\nclass Vector {\n    // class body\n};\n```\nHint: A class is defined using the keyword 'class', followed by the class name and curly braces.\nIncorrect Response: \n```cpp\nVector class {\n    // class body\n};\n```\nFeedback: The correct keyword order is 'class', followed by the class name. It should be 'class Vector', not 'Vector class'.\n\nSubproblem 2: Create a constructor for the Vector class that takes an integer 'n' and initializes a vector of that size.\nAnswer: \n```cpp\nclass Vector {\n    private:\n        int* vect;\n        int size;\n    public:\n        Vector(int n) {\n            size = n;\n            vect = new int[n];\n        }\n};\n```\nHint: Use the public access specifier for the constructor. The constructor should have the same name as the class and take an integer as an argument.\nIncorrect Response: \n```cpp\nclass Vector {\n    Vector(n) {\n        size = n;\n    }\n};\n```\nFeedback: Don't forget to specify the datatype of the constructor argument. Also, constructor must be under public access specifier. Correct way is: Vector(int n).\n\nSubproblem 3: Add a method to add elements to the vector.\nAnswer: \n```cpp\nclass Vector {\n    // previous code\n    public:\n        void add(int idx, int val) {\n            if(idx >= 0 && idx < size)\n                vect[idx] = val;\n        }\n};\n```\nHint: Define a public method 'add' that takes an index and a value, and adds the value at the given index in the vector. Ignore the addition if the index is out of range.\nIncorrect Response: \n```cpp\nclass Vector {\n    // previous code\n    public:\n        add(int idx, int val) {\n            vect[idx] = val;\n        }\n};\n```\nFeedback: Remember to specify the return type of the method. Here, since we're not returning any value, the return type should be 'void'.\n\nSubproblem 4: Add a method to find the length of the vector.\nAnswer: \n```cpp\nclass Vector {\n    // previous code\n    public:\n        int length() {\n            return size;\n        }\n};\n```\nHint: Define a public method 'length' that returns the length of the vector. \nIncorrect Response: \n```cpp\nclass Vector {\n    // previous code\n    public:\n        length() {\n            return size;\n        }\n};\n```\nFeedback: Don't forget to specify the method's return type. In this case, it should be 'int' as the length of a vector would be an integer.\n\nSolution:\n```cpp\nclass Vector {\n    private:\n        int* vect;\n        int size;\n\n    public:\n        Vector(int n) {\n            size = n;\n            vect = new int[n];\n        }\n        \n        void add(int idx, int val) {\n            if(idx >= 0 && idx < size)\n                vect[idx] = val;\n        }\n\n        int length() {\n            return size;\n        }\n    };\n```"

The correct header files are 'algorithm' and 'vector'.\n\nSubProblem 2:\nQuestion: How do you declare an array of integers using STL?\nAnswer: vector<int> arr = {1, 2, 3};\nHint: In STL, arrays can be represented using a vector.\nIncorrect Response: array<int, 4> arr = {1, 2, 3};\nFeedback: Although 'array' is a container class in STL, we mostly prefer 'vector' for its flexibility of size.\n\nSubProblem 3:\nQuestion: How do you find the maximum and minimum elements in an array using STL algorithms?\nAnswer: *max_element(arr.begin(), arr.end()) and *min_element(arr.begin(), arr.end())\nHint: 'max_element' and 'min_element' functions are used to find maximum and minimum elements in the array. They return a pointer pointing to max or min element.\nIncorrect Response: max(arr.begin(), arr.end()) and min(arr.begin(), arr.end())\nFeedback: 'max' and 'min' functions only compare two values and return the max or min respectively. You should use 'max_element' and 'min_element' to find max and min in an array.\n\nFinal Solution:\n```\n#include<iostream>\n#include<algorithm>\n#include<vector>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    vector<int> arr = {4, 88, 20, 12, 5, 10};\n    cout << \"Maximum Element = \" << *max_element(arr.begin(), arr.end());\n    cout << \"\\nMinimum Element = \" << *min_element(arr.begin(), arr.end());\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nJSON structure:\n```\n{\n    \"SubProblems\": [\n            {\n                \"Question\": \"What are the necessary header files to include for using STL in C++?\",\n                \"Answer\": \"#include<algorithm> and #include<vector>\",\n                \"Hint\": \"STL algorithms are defined in the algorithm header file and vector, a type of container, is declared in the vector header file.\",\n                \"Incorrect Response\": \"#include<math> and #include<array>\",\n                \"Feedback\": \"The header files 'math' and 'array' are not correct.
