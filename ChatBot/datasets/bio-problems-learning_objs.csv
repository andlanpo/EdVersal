This gradient is maintained because the inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to protons, preventing them from easily leaking back into the matrix. The proton gradient is then used to power ATP synthase, which synthesizes ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate as protons flow back into the mitochondrial matrix through the enzyme.""

Stomatal regulation may also be a factor, as the plant may be opening its stomata to cool down, but this is also causing water loss.

    ""Solution"": ""We can use the equation for exponential growth to find the population size after 5 years: N(t) = N0 * e^(rt). N(5) = 1000 * e^(0.1*5) = 1628. We can then use the equation for logistic growth to find the final population size: dN/dt = rN(K-N)/K. The maximum growth rate is 200 individuals per year, so r = 0.2. The carrying capacity is not given, so we will assume it is 5000 based on the resources available. dN/dt = 0 at the carrying capacity, so we can set dN/dt = 0 and solve for N: 0 = 0.2N(5000-N)/5000. This gives us N = 0 or N = 4000. Since the initial population is 1000, the final population must be between 1000 and 4000. We already found that the population size after 5 years is 1628, so we know that it is less than 4000. Therefore, the final population size must be greater than 1628. The answer is the final population size, which is greater than 1628 and less than or equal to 4000.""
